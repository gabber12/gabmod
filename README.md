gabmodal.js
===========

gabmodal is a lightweight implementation of modals with no dependency.
The library comes out of the box with a expand and fade effect for modal.
Theming can either be done by changing css or changing variables in scss(preferred).

Usage
-----

    <script>
            var modal = new Modal({
                id:"myModal"
            });
    </script>
